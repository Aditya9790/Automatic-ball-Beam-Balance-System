# Automatic-ball-Beam-Balance-System
- I along with my colleague simulated a ball beam balancing system using SIMULINK (MATLAB) and knowledge of control system domain.
- A rolling ball on a beam will regulate itself and the system will prevent it from falling by regulating the beam with the help of a servo motor.
- We also created a GUI with the help of MATLAB SIMULINK which demonstrated the proposed model.
